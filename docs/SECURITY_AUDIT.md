# Security Audit Report

**Date:** July 30, 2025  
**Auditor:** Devin AI  
**Project:** ORIUM Blockchain v0.1.0-alpha  
**Scope:** Comprehensive security audit including dependency vulnerabilities, code analysis, and CI/CD pipeline review

## Executive Summary

This security audit identified **7 security vulnerabilities** and **10 maintenance warnings** in the ORIUM blockchain dependencies. Additionally, compilation issues prevent full code analysis with clippy and testing frameworks.

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** 1 vulnerability (ring AES overflow)
- **Medium Risk:** 4 vulnerabilities (timing attacks, infinite loops, sandbox bypass)
- **Low Risk:** 2 vulnerabilities (Punycode handling, WASM miscompilation)
- **Maintenance Risk:** 10 unmaintained dependencies

## Compilation Status

### Build Status: ❌ FAILED
- **cargo build --release:** Failed due to Substrate framework version compatibility
- **cargo test --workspace:** Failed due to `try_runtime_enabled` not found in `frame_support`
- **cargo clippy:** Failed due to same compilation errors

### Root Cause
Substrate framework version incompatibility in `frame-system-37.1.0`:
```
error[E0433]: failed to resolve: could not find `try_runtime_enabled` in `frame_support`
```

**Recommendation:** Update Substrate dependencies to compatible versions before production deployment.

### 7. wasmtime - WASM Miscompilation (RUSTSEC-2023-0063)
- **Severity:** Low (CVSS 2.2)
- **Version:** 8.0.1
- **Issue:** Miscompilation of `i64x2.shr_s` instruction on x86_64
- **Impact:** Incorrect WASM execution results
- **Solution:** Upgrade to ≥10.0.2, <11.0.0 OR ≥11.0.2, <12.0.0 OR ≥12.0.2
- **Dependency Path:** `wasmtime → [WASM runtime components]`

## Maintenance Warnings

The following dependencies are unmaintained and should be replaced:

1. **ansi_term (0.12.1)** - Unmaintained terminal color library
2. **derivative (2.2.0)** - Unmaintained derive macro library
3. **instant (0.1.13)** - Unmaintained time library
4. **mach (0.3.2)** - Unmaintained macOS system interface
5. **parity-wasm (0.45.0)** - Deprecated by author
6. **paste (1.0.15)** - No longer maintained
7. **proc-macro-error (1.0.4)** - Unmaintained procedural macro library
8. **ring (0.16.20)** - Versions prior to 0.17 are unmaintained
9. **trust-dns-proto (0.23.2)** - Rebranded to hickory-dns

## Ignored Vulnerabilities

None. All identified vulnerabilities should be addressed before production deployment.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical)
1. **Fix Substrate Dependencies:** Resolve version compatibility issues to enable compilation
2. **Upgrade ring:** Critical security fix for AES overflow panic
3. **Update rustls:** Fix infinite loop vulnerability

### Short-term Actions (High Priority)
1. **Upgrade curve25519-dalek:** Mitigate timing attack vectors
2. **Update wasmtime:** Address sandbox bypass and miscompilation issues
3. **Replace unmaintained dependencies:** Migrate to actively maintained alternatives

### Long-term Actions (Medium Priority)
1. **Dependency Management:** Implement automated dependency scanning in CI/CD
2. **Security Monitoring:** Set up alerts for new vulnerabilities in dependencies
3. **Regular Audits:** Schedule quarterly security audits

## CI/CD Pipeline Status

### Current Status: ❌ FAILING
- **Build Job:** Failing due to Substrate version conflicts
- **Test Job:** Cannot execute due to compilation failures
- **Lint Job:** Cannot execute due to compilation failures
- **Security Job:** Partially working (cargo-audit successful)
- **Docker Job:** Status unknown due to build failures

### Required Fixes
1. Update Substrate framework dependencies to compatible versions
2. Ensure all security vulnerabilities are patched
3. Verify all CI jobs pass before production deployment

## Conclusion

The ORIUM blockchain project requires immediate attention to resolve critical dependency vulnerabilities and compilation issues. The security audit identified significant risks that must be addressed before any production deployment. Priority should be given to fixing the Substrate framework compatibility and upgrading critical security dependencies.

**Overall Security Rating: ⚠️ NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION**
